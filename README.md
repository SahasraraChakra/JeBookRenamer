### "J Soft Ebook Renamer"

#

I have a lot of ebooks. really alot.... Most of them which I dont even remember when did I got them. Most of them, I didn't even looked at inside yet. Still I would like to rename them properly so I could understand what the topic, title, which edition, when published, whithout opening them. so I was thinking of renaming them. But there were alot to manually rename them. So I went on a quest to find a perfect ebook renamer, there are a few but they dont fit to my needs. So I thought I would make a one, as I am a developer, and most of the books on Programming.

I, intially started this project as a tryout to my long lasting lust for VB6, which I always fonded with since when I started learning programming in 1990s, which I still never learned more than basic. May be it is because it is Visual "Basic" !!! So, I thought to give this a try in VB, which I made and worked well. So thought I would make this in Java too, as Java is main main programming language, and mainly because, the COM component dependablity and Platform dependancy of VB. So here it is in Java...

## Features

- Preview the final name as you type.
- Auto move to next in list for easy editing
- Move to other folder after renaming
- Create sub folders based on topics
- and wishing to add more...! (in future of course)

This is public and free and open source. Anyone is welcome to make it better. I dont care what you do with it, whether make it look good, or work faster, or add features : anything... unless you dont use it for commercial purpose... If you use it for commercial purpose, ofcourse, you have pay my share...!

## Tech

The System I have used in this

- [Open JDK] -  OpenJDK 23 Runtime Environment (build 23.0.2+7-58)
- [Apache Net Beans] - A Great IDE for Java : ver 25
- [Icons] - Various Icons scavanged from Intenet, app Icon I made it myself. (You can see that!)

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

## Installation

If you are a user not a developer, you would need a Java Runtime 8 or later. Please use Search engine to find a one

(2) Earlier VB6 version:
- Needs External COM Controls to be registered (Free controls ofcourse - Krool's `VBCCR18.OCX`) with `regsvr32`.
- And Unicode file names also can be a problem.
- As I am no master in VB fixes for this version will be depend on feature thoughts.
