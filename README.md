I have a lot of ebooks... Really a lot, hundreds of them collected from all around internet form whereever possible.
all of the come with no proper file name or titles, so that the book or its content can be easily identified. so i made a file renamer to automate renaming the books as per my need. 

this is configured as per my requirement. if  this works for you, feel free to use it. or if you are a developer and want to make it more complex, use the code! 

Hope this helps anyone !!!
